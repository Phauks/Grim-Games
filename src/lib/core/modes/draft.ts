/**
 * A draft (assignment kind `draft`, Sushi Buffet): seat by seat, the player is offered a few
 * characters from the pool and keeps one. Refusing an offer brings the next, smaller one
 * (3 → 2 → 1); the last offer can't be refused. Characters not kept are discarded, or go
 * back in the pool when `recycleUnchosen` is set. Only types with an open slot are offered,
 * so every pick fits the setup counts. Rules: https://grimbits.com/draft-buffet/.
 *
 * The slots are the counts the draft starts with; no drafted character changes them (Trevor,
 * 2026-10-19: "There is no automatic changes of the count of players").
 *
 * The state is plain data so it can be saved on the device and resumed.
